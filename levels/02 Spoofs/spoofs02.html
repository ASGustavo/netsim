<h1>Spoofs Level 2</h1>

<p>This level contains several devices connected to a <strong>switch</strong>. A <strong>switch</strong> is similar
to a router, but it starts out with an empty <strong>routing table</strong>. Over time, it learns where to send
packets that belong to a specific destination. Observe how the <strong>switch</strong> learns where devices are
connected over time.

<p>Your goal is to "steal" a packet intended to be sent to Charlie.
To do this, take advantage of the switch's learning process to direct packets with a dstip of Charlie to Alice's
computer.

<p><em><strong>Hint:</strong> Use the timer in the top right of the Simulator&mdash;beating this level will require careful timing!</em>

<h3>Level Objectives</h3>

<ul><li>use Alice to steal a packet sent from Google to Charlie</li></ul>
