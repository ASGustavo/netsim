
<p>In this level, you will learn how to create <strong>packets</strong> and send them from one computer to another.

<p>Pause the simulation and click on the <strong>packet</strong> that is sent from Bob's <strong>computer</strong>
 to Alice's <strong>computer</strong>. The information about a packet is contained in its packet <strong>headers</strong>.
 This is a simple packet that only lists information in the <strong>network layer</strong>. Note the two pieces of
 information contained in this header: <strong>srcip</strong> (the source of the packet) and <strong>dstip</strong>
 (the destination of the packet).
 
 <p>To pass this level, you will need to send a packet from Alice to Bob. To do this:
 
 <ul>
 	<li>open the Timeline Editor 
	<li>open <strong>Basics &rarr; Level 2</strong> by going to <strong>File &rarr; Change level</strong>
	<li>add a new packet by selecting the Add Packet option from the File menu (or by pressing <strong>Ctrl+N</strong>)
	<li>we need to send this packet <strong>from</strong> Alice, so make sure she is selected in the From: dropdown
	<li>you need to set the <strong>srcip</strong> and <strong>dstip</strong> headers in the network layer<br>
	    <em>hint: restart and pause the simulator to click on packets and see what their headers look like</em>
	<li>save your new packet by selecting the Save option from the dropdown menu (or by pressing <strong>Ctrl+S</strong>)
</ul>

<p>Now that you have saved a packet to the timeline, go back to the Simulator and press <span class="button">reload</span>. 
When the timer in the corner hits the "At:" value of your packet, it will be sent!</p>
