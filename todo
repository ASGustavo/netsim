blocking
- update "you win" dialog to handle no nextLevel property
- prettier level listing
- method to work on test levels

nice to have
- resize game on resize viewport (attempt at this at top of ui.js but it's laggy)
- screenshots for level selector?
- differentiate launcher buttons
- coloured packets
- differentiate/label devices
- only preload used device sprites
- move levels to database
- level editor

long term
- non-php version
--- load json/html via ajax
--- remove login system
--- remove saving
--- add warning screen about that
- paid-hosting version?
- wireless
- patreon

level ideas
- ping, tracert
- privacy (see ISPs, who can read data, etc)
- how protocols work (HTTP, DNS, email, DHCP...)
