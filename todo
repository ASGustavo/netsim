blocking
- remove CSS lines from beginning of each level
- update sprites & layouts in level files
- update ui-specific mentions in level descrips
- convert triggers in level files to arrays
- update nextLevel in each file
- update "you win" dialog to handle no nextLevel property
- prettier level listing
- resize game on resize viewport (attempt at this at top of ui.js but it's laggy)
- 'repeat' packet property
- device scripts (?list)
- method to work on test levels
- hosted version on DO

nice to have
- screenshots for level selector?
- differentiate launcher buttons
- coloured packets
- differentiate/label devices
- only preload used device sprites
- move levels to database
- level editor
- more variety in device sprites
- slower intro/learning levels

long term
- licensing
- non-php version
--- load json/html via ajax
--- remove login system
--- remove saving
--- add warning screen about that
- paid-hosting version?
- wireless
- patreon

level ideas
- ping, tracert
- privacy (see ISPs, who can read data, etc)
- how protocols work (HTTP, DNS, email, DHCP...)
